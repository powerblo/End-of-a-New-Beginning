Congratulations, you have succeeded in downloading End of a new Beginning from GitHub!

To install the mod, simply place the "toi" folder and the "toi" file in "Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod"

If you have file extensions enabled, the "toi" file may be called "toi.mod"

The "LICENSE" and "README" files are just for GitHub and can be deleted.

Have fun!

 AUSdiplo.1.t:0 "The Future of Lombardy-Venetia"
 AUSdiplo.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia has been ours since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat. The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."
 AUSdiplo.1.a:0 "Annex Venetia"
 AUSdiplo.1.b:0 "Enforce the Status Quo"
 AUSdiplo.1.c:0 "Loosen the grip on the Kingdom"
 AUSdiplo.2.t:0 "The Future of Modena, Parma and Tuscany"
 AUSdiplo.2.d:0 "The three Central Italian states/:/ Modena, Parma and Tuscany have belonged to our sphere of influence since the Congress of Vienna. The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany have been ruled by the Habsburgs while the Duchy of Parma has been ruled by a Bourbon, which has effectively made these three states our client states due to our ideological and military support to them. With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations. Liberals on the other hand propose that we create a loose confederation named the "Italian League" to convince the Italians that the Habsburgs have only good plans for Italy."

 AUSdiplo.2.b:0 "Enforce the Status Quo"
 AUSdiplo.3.t:0 "Cede Savoy and Nice to France"
 AUSdiplo.3.d:0 "The territories of Savoy and Nice located on the border between Italy and France have always been a contentious issue. For centuries both Italian, they were in 1792 annexed in the French Republic due to their high French population before being returned to Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Now that Piedmont is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France. Doing so will increase our relations with Napoleonic France, which might entice them to help us in our struggle with Prussa, but it will alienate Britain, and will anger Italian nationalists even further."
 AUSdiplo.3.a:0 "We need all the friends we can get"
 AUSdiplo.3.b:0 "It is too risky"
 AUSdiplo.4.t:0 "Austria cedes Savoy and Nice"
 AUSdiplo.4.d:0 "On [GetDateText] our troops entered Savoie and Nice for the first time since 1815, when it was ceded to the Piedmontese. The population cheered the French troops and thousands attended the official ceremony of the handing of Chambery from Austria to France. The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Interior Minister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement the Austrians showed that not only they can be trusted, but in fact they can be good friends of ours. The Emperor later declared that 'the old grudge between France and the Habsburgs has been ended, now we can only expect friendship', effectively instructing the politicians to consider Austria a friend, not an enemy."
 AUSdiplo.4.a:0 "Wonderful"
 AUSdiplo.5.t:0 "Austria cedes Savoy and Nice to France"
 AUSdiplo.5.d:0 "The territories of Savoy and Nice located on the border between Italy and France have always been a contentious issue. For centuries both Italian, they were in 1792 annexed in the French Republic due to their high French population before being returned to Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. With Austria defeating Piedmont and then imposing a puppet state over it, they decided to cede Savoy and Nice to Napoleonic France. While this is a minor event on its own, it might suggest a rapprochement between Austria and Franch who after all share the same ideological values and are both hostile against Prussia. Should such an alliance be formed, it would be very dangerous for the stability of Europe."
 AUSdiplo.5.a:0 "Worrisome"
 
 AUSgenerals.1.t:0 "Dismissing Feldmarschall Ferenc Gyulay"
 AUSgenerals.1.d:0 "Count Ferenc Gyulay who was named Feldmarschall only a few years ago has proven to be an incompetent military commander with his crushing defeat in the Battle of Magenta against the Italians and their French Allies. It is wise that he is to be recalled back to Wien, and instead let the Emperor take direct control of the situation to avoid demoralizing entirely the Austrian army. Should Ferenc Gyulay remain as Feldmarschall, this will surely anger the people and the army."

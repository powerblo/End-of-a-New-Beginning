 nap_france.1.d:0 "Since the 1852 coup, the French Empire was ruled under the authoritarian rulership of its emperor, but ever growing dissent in the political spheres and with the power of the republicans growing every day, we need to make an important decision about the future of our Empire. Will it be a liberal empire, to please both the republican and the people of France, or will we keep authoritarianism, that while it is unpopular, will keep the military and the loyalists content?"

 nap_france.5.t:0 "The French Empire are supporting republican revolutionaries"
 nap_france.5.d:0 "Our spies scattered around the southern italian countryside seems to have catched some french diplomats meeting with known Carbonari revolutionaries.

 nap_france.13.d:0 "Savoy was promised to us after the treaty of Turin, and while Italy agreed to it, the savoyard didn't. They proposed to us a referendum, that we obviously denied, after all they are now officialy french whether they like it or not. It turns out that they don't, and now declared their independance. The transfer of the land came with the condition of neutrality of the territory in european diplomacy, this allowed them to gain the support of the neighboring Switzerland and Italy that backs the treaty, saying that France has no right to impose rule over neutral land. But it's now too late, and independance, followed by war, has been declared."

 nap_france.16.d:0 "Even if France and the United Kingdom share the same historical rivalry, we still believe in the same ideals, and also in the same economic principles. Put aside our differences, an economic treaty between us will strenghten our bond even more after both the Second Opium War and the Crimean War, something that can only benefit both of us. However, we have seen the french emperor erratic side, and if they drag us into disaster, we don't want to also be economically tied to them."

 nap_france.17.t:0 "The Cobden-Chevalier Treaty has been signed"
 nap_france.17.d:0 "An agreement between France and the United Kingdom as been reached, and a trade deal has been signed, now called the Cobden-Chevalier treaty because of the two ambassadors that agreed upon the treaty, the british Richard Cobden and the french Michel Chevalier.

 nap_france.17.a:0 "Fantastique !"

 nap_france.18.t:0 "[ENG.GetLeader]'s government has refused our offer"
 nap_france.18.d:0 "The heated talks or the french and british economic meeting couldn't have had a worst ending, both the french and british ambassador left the building only after a few hours into the discussion, leaving the french and british government in dismay. Either the treaty was too harsh, or it demanded too much concession, or the traditional franco-british hatred as struck again, in the end the result was the same. A bitter discussion followed by a bitter ending, and our plans for a trade deal destroyed."

While we watch the fight from far away across the Atlantic, we are forced to admit that the matter of the United States have an impact in the entire world, and so we need to make our opinion on the matter. On one hand, the Confederates States of America, or CSA, have all of the precious cotton and if independent, will be an important player in the Caribbean Sea, where we have holdings, so supporting them would allow us a better control of the area. On the other hand, the United States have always been a close partners, and our shared history allow us a closer relations, on top of the fact that they have superior numbers and industry and is so likely to win the civil war. We could, of course, always take a neutral stance on the matter. We win nothing but at least we don't loose anything if we bet on the world side."

vbritain.1.t:0 "Opening of the British Museum Reading Room"
vbritain.1.d:0 "Since the early 1850s, the British Museum needed a bigger reading room. The idea of a huge circular room quickly came up, and the works started in 1854, overseen by the architect Sydney Smirke, and finished this week. The building itself is made of cast iron, concrete and glass, and was inspired by the Pantheon of Rome in its design and colors."
vbritain.1.a:0 "A wonderful building"

vbritain.2.t:0 "Victoria Cross awards in Hyde Park"
vbritain.2.d:0 "Following the Crimean War, some British Troops had distinguished themselves from their fellow men by acts of bravery or ingenuity, and today is the day our country will reward them for it. Queen Victoria has awarded 66 Victorian Crosses today at a ceremony in London to our best men. Royal Troops have proven their worth once more!"
vbritain.2.a:0 "For the valient soldiers of Britannia"

vbritain.3.t:0 "The Orsini Affair"
vbritain.3.d:0 "A attack as hit the french emperor Napoleon III today in Paris. While the perpetrator was the italian revolutionary Felice Orsini, a french investigation has shown that the bomb used for the attack was made in the United Kingdom. This has put us in a difficult position with the french government, and they are waiting for a response from us."
vbritain.3.a:0 "We need to investigate this"

vbritain.4.t:0 "Religious Revolts in Belfast"
vbritain.4.d:0 "In Belfast today, a crowd of Catholics is fighting another Protestants crowd, led by the evengelical presbytarian Hugh Hanna, in the streets. The riot seems to have propagated to other neighboring cities, like Derry, Portadown or even Lurgan. The police has been sent on the scene, but they seem to mostly join the Protestant side of the fight."
vbritain.4.a:0 "Support the police's choice"
vbritain.4.b:0 "We need to protect both crowds equally"

vbritain.5.t:0 "The Matrimonial Clauses Act"
vbritain.5.d:0 "Talks started today on an act that would let married couple to divorce without the formal approval of a parliamentary body, and moving the matter from an ecclesiastical court to a civil court. This would, in practice, make marriage less of a sacrament, and more of a contract between the husband and wife. While the proposal has gathered support in the parliament, there are still some oppposition."
vbritain.5.a:0 "Push for the Act"
vbritain.5.b:0 "Let the Parliament decide"

vbritain.6.t:0 "Results of the vote for the Matrimonial Clauses Act"
vbritain.6.d:0 "Lord Parmerston announced today the succesful vote of the Matrimonial Clauses Act. Despite the disapproval of some proheminent figures like the bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce and the attempted fillibuster of the liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, a push from Lord Palmerston gave the bill enough momentum to pass. It is expected to be enacted on Jaunuary 1st of the next year."
vbritain.6.a:0 "Wonderful !"

vbritain.7.t:0 "Results of the vote for the Matrimonial Clauses Act"

It is expected to be enacted on Jaunuary 1st of the next year."
vbritain.7.a:0 "Wonderful !"

vbritain.8.t:0 "Results of the vote for the Matrimonial Clauses Act"
vbritain.8.d:0 "Lord Parmerston announced today the failed vote of the Matrimonial Clauses Act. Political pressure on both the conservative and the Church-supporting liberal side of the Parliament was too much for the act to gain popularity. It is seen as a failure of the Palmerston government, and will surely weaken his grip, both on the House of Lord and the House of Commons."

The popular sport has gripped the young men of our nation in a way no other activity has yet before, and it was only a matter of time before the first organizations on this subject were founded. Today, the first Football Club in Britain is founded in Sheffield, called the Sheffield FC. We predict that this sport will continue to see an increase in popularity in the future."
vbritain.10.a:0 "Alright!"

vbritain.11.t:0 "Piedmontese revolutionary leave his exile"
vbritain.11.d:0 "Felice Orsini has left his exile in London.

After going around Europe, trying to find a good place to stay while he can't go back to his home land, he ended up in the United Kingdom were he was well received. While in his London exile though, he is suspected to still be in contact with revolutionaries, and he might plot something against a great figure. He seemed to leave the UK to reach France, who knows what he might do there."

However, with the rise of socialism, with the Chartists, and with the new wave of free-thought and strive for liberty, the republic is put once again on the table.

Projected, the image of the Sun produced by an optical telescope through a broad-band filter makes a solar flare obvious to the eye, as it produce a good amound of H-alpha radiation, adding a narrow, around 1 Å, passband filter centered at this wavelength. While it might not be clear what causes such events on the surface of our Sun, it has excited the astronomical world greatly. More observations will be needed though, and with more precise instrumentation."

They have one single, simple request: to hold a new general election, and to choose another Prime Minister to represent adeqatly the will of the citizens of the kingdom. While it might weaken our rule, and put our monarchy in peril, we might want to accept this condition, as refusing it might have catastrophic consequances."

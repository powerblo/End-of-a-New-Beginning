 # Greek Events #

 Greecemisc.1.t:0 "Prime Minister Voulgaris Resigns"
 Greecemisc.1.d:0 "Today Prime Minister Dimitrios Voulgaris resigned following a fight he had with King Otto. Voulgaris is known to be an intelligent and capable admnistrator, but also very hot headed and controlling. With his resignation we have but to appoint a new Prime Minister, who will be more loyal to the King than to his own interests. Athanasios Miaoulis, the son of the great naval officer during the revolution Andreas Miaoulis, is considered an ideal candidate, loyal to the Monarchy and popular to the people."
 Greecemisc.1.a:0 "Miaoulis shall be the new Prime Minister"
 Greecemisc.2.t:0 "Election Fraud?"
 Greecemisc.2.d:0 "With the new elections being conducted, we can opt to support the royal faction through election fraud. This would consist of pressuring people to vote for us in the electoral centres and of inflating the numbers in our favour."
 Greecemisc.2.a:0 "Just a few more votes in favour..."
 Greecemisc.2.b:0 "No. We should not intervene"
 Greecemisc.3.t:0 "Newspaper Slams the Monarchy"
 Greecemisc.3.d:0 "A well known newspaper has today published an article where it condemns King Otto and the Monarchy 'for being responsible for the poor economic and political state of the nation' and advocates 'establishing a republic worthy of our ancestors'. These slanders should not go unpunished, or else it would weaken our side."
 Greecemisc.3.a:0 "Arrest the journalist"
 Greecemisc.3.b:0 "No censorship in our nation"
 Greecemisc.4.t:0 "Public Protests"
 Greecemisc.4.d:0 "Today, thousands of citizens have organised protests in Athens under the auspices of the Republicans against the current administration and the Monarchy. They demand the Prime Minister to resign, and the King to 'become competent'. Naturally such public signs of dissent can only serve to hurt the monarchy and we should intervene before it is too late."
 Greecemisc.4.a:0 "Crack down on the protests"
 Greecemisc.4.b:0 "These are merely minor disturbances"
 Greecemisc.5.t:0 "Miaoulis Resigns"
 Greecemisc.5.d:0 "Prime Minister Miaoulis has resigned due to the rising dissent of the people against him and King after the Nauplian Revolution. With Miaoulis' resignation we have but one option, and that is to appoint Ioannis 'Gennaios Kolokotronis', the son of the great hero of the revolutionary war, Theodoros Kolokotronis, like Miaoulis he is very popular with the people and he might help revive the popularity of the monarchy, which over the years has become weaker and weaker."
 Greecemisc.5.a:0 "Accept the resignation"
 Greecemisc.5.b:0 "Reject the resignation"
 miaoulis_remove:0 "Removing §YMiaoulis§! will be §Runpopular§!"
 Greecemisc.6.t:0 "The Nauplian Revolution"
 Greecemisc.6.d:0 "Dire news have arrived from the city of Nauplion, in the nomos of Argolis in the Peloponnese, several thousand men have taken the arms and have declared a revolt against King Otto. It seems that the people have grown very much angered with the irresponsible behaviour of Otto, and his policies which have resulted in little change in the economic situation of the country since 1833, when Otto first arrived, ironically, in Nauplion. Otto's monarchy began in Nauplion, and it seems it will end from there."
 Greecemisc.6.a:0 "Supress the revolt immediately"
 Greecemisc.7.t:0 "The Skiadika Events"
 Greecemisc.7.d:0 "The day before yesterday several hundred students went to the Field of Mars wearing 'skiadia', a type of straw hat made in Greece. The protest was an idea of Cleon Ragazis, the son of Alexander Ragazis, the Foreign Minister. The goal was to entice the upper classes to buy Greek hats but it went wrong as the hat importers sent their own agents to make fun of the protesters, resulting in violent actions from both sides and the intervention of the police. The next day they organized a new protest, and demanded the resignation of the head of police and a meeting with Otto. Their demands were denied resulting in the arrests of the students, ending the protests."
 Greecemisc.7.a:0 "Liberate the students"
 Greecemisc.8.t:0 "Assassination Attempt on Queen Amalia"
 Greecemisc.8.d:0 "On September 18th, 1861, while Queen Amalia was riding on her horse near the grounds of the Royal Palace, a young student named Aristidis Dosios tried to kill Queen Amalia. He was unsuccessful because the Queen turned the horse on him and he did not manage to aim properly. The motive for the attempt was to destabilize the regime since Queen Amalia was the regent of Greece, as King Otto was in a foreign trip. The failure of the attempt managed to revive some popularity of the monarchy, though the revival proved short lived."
 Greecemisc.8.a:0 "Sympathy to the Queen"
 
 Greeceelections.1.t:0 "The 1859 Elections"
 Greeceelections.1.d:0 "The Elections of 1859 are set to begin today and this will be a great struggle between the absolutist current government and the constitutionalist opposition. Prime Minister Miaoulis is expected to perform, though we might need to 'help' the absolutist faction against the constitutionalists."
 Greeceelections.1.a:0 "Begin the Elections"
 Greeceelections.2.t:0 "The End of the 1859 Elections"
 Greeceelections.2.d:0 "The Elections of 1859 have ended after several months of intense campaigning by both sides, and widespread accusations of electoral irregularity. The votes have been counted and the new government is soon expected to be called to the Royal Palace to be appointed by the King."
 Greeceelections.2.a:0 "The Monarchists win"
 Greeceelections.2.b:0 "The Constitutionalists win"

 GREpolitics.1.t:0 "The Abdication of Otto"
 GREpolitics.1.d:0 "On October 11th the Hellenic Parliament, which was under the control of the revolutionaries, declared Otto's position as King of Greece 'null and void' and declared a new government under Voulgaris, Canaris and Roufos, until the convention of a national assembly to elect a new King. The next day the Royal Yatch 'Amalia' entered Piraeus, and Otto was informed of the news. On that night the Yatch was joined by the British ship 'Scylla' and the French Ship 'Deer' and landed at Salamis. Otto decided then to flee Greece with the ship 'Scylla' to Venice, effectively resigning from the Greek throne, though this was not confirmed officialy. Now Greece is free to chose her future."
 GREpolitics.1.a:0 "An Incompetent King"
 GREpolitics.3.t:0 "The Death of King Otto I"
 GREpolitics.3.d:0 "On this day, on the year [GetYear], His Majesty, King Otto I of Greece, of the House von Wittelsbach, has passed away, and he will now rest in peace. His Majesty's Funeral was attended by several thousand loyal citizens, as well as by the Wittelsbachs, yet with his passing there was also much apathy or even anger by a part of the population that still considered His Majesty a failed leader. Prince Luitpold von Wittelsbach has been chosen as the next King, as he is the rightful heir, and he is expected to be baptised Orthodox as the Constitution requires soon enough in order to arrive in to Greece and to be crowned."
 GREpolitics.3.a:0 "Rest in Peace, King Otto"
 GREpolitics.4.t:0 "The Referendum of 1862"
 GREpolitics.4.d:0 "The time has come to conduct the referendum to chose whether we will crown a King or install a Republic. The most popular choice so far for King seems to be Alfred von Saxe-Coburg Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and the heir to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. He is a young man and very popular to most Greeks, who believe that if the British are friendly to us, the liberation of our territories will be achieved easily. On the other hand, a significant portion of our population wants to see the abolishment of the monarchy and the establishement of a Republic. If we remain a monarchy, we will enjoy the support of the Great Powers, but with the limitations that come with it, if we become a Republic, we will be initially isolated, but a bright future opens up."
 GREpolitics.4.a:0 "Conduct the Referendum"
 GRE_tt_conduct_referenduma:0 "Conduct the referendum to chose between a §YMonarchy§! or a §YRepublic§!"
 GREpolitics.4.b:0 "Do not conduct the Referendum"
 GRE_tt_not_conduct_referenduma:0 "Not conducting the referendum might spark a §RRepublican Coup§!"
 GREpolitics.5.t:0 "The End of the Referendum"
 GREpolitics.5.d:0 "The Referendum has been ended and the votes have been counted. After several months of intense campaigning the referendum has ended and the votes have been counted. Unsurprisingly there have been electoral irregularities, and even interference from foreign powers, but now all that matters is the result. Whoever wins will be tasked with rebuilding a divided nation."
 GREpolitics.5.a:0 "The Election of Alfred von Saxe-Coburg and Gotha"
 GREpolitics.5.b:0 "The Republicans prevail"
 GREpolitics.6.t:0 "Alfred elected King in Greece"
 GREpolitics.6.d:0 "Prince Albert von Saxe-Coburg Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria has been reportedly elected King of Greece in a referendum conducted amongst the Greek populace following the abdication of the former King, the Bavarian Otto von Wittelsbach, who was deeply unpopular due to his absolutist practices which ravaged the economy of the nation. Should Prince Albert be allowed to become King of Greece, this would reinforce our standing with the Greeks, but at the same time this will cause great dissatisfaction amongst the other guaranteeing powers of Greece: France and Russia, and will disrupt the fragile balance of powers."
 GREpolitics.6.a:0 "Allow Alfred to become King"
 GREpolitics.6.b:0 "Do not allow Alfred to become King"
 GREpolitics.7.t:0 "The coronation of King Alfred I"
 GREpolitics.7.d:0 "King Alfred I has been crowned King of the Greeks in a private ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Avoiding the pomp of his precedecessor, the whole affair of Alfred's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Albert has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and underproductive. Nevertheless with his extensive influence with the United Kingdom and Germany he is expected to campaign in favour of reclaiming our territories."
 GREpolitics.7.a:0 "Long live the new King"
 GREpolitics.8.t:0 "Alfred not allowed to become King"
 GREpolitics.8.d:0 "Queen Victoria has rejected the Greek demands that Prince Alfred becomes King of Greece. Her rejection comes from the concerns voiced from France and Russia that the United Kingdom would gain too much power in Greece, and now we have to find a new King. A suitable candidate would be Prins Vilhelm von Glucksburg, the son of the Crown Prince Christian of Denmark and who belongs to a minor dynasty with no major claims or pretentions, and thus an ideal candidate approved by the Great Powers. Prince Vilhelm may not have as close relations to the British as Alfred, but he is a worthy substitute and his family has connections with nearly every European house."
 GREpolitics.8.a:0 "What about Prince Vilhelm of Denmark"
 GREpolitics.9.t:0 "The coronation of King George I"
 GREpolitics.9.d:0 "Prins Vilhelm von Glucksburg, who has recently come from Denmark, was today crowned King of the Greeks, under the regnal name of George which is much easier to pronounce, in a private ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Avoiding the pomp of his precedecessor, the whole affair of George's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Geirge has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and underproductive. Nevertheless with his extensive influence with the United Kingdom and Germany he is expected to campaign in favour of reclaiming our territories."
 GREpolitics.9.a:0 "Long live the new King"
 GREpolitics.10.t:0 "The coronation of King Leopold I"
 GREpolitics.10.d:0 "Prince Luitpold von Wittelsbach, the younger brother of the late King Otto was today crowned King of Greece in a lavish ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Trying to prove to his new subjects that he is fit to rule, the coronation was very expensive and impressed many attendants of the competence of the new King. Nevertheless, the majority of the population views the new King with skepticism as he is overshadowed by his predecessors unpopularity and the fact that his conversion to Orthodox Christianity a few days prior to the coronation was viewed very oddly. King Leopold will have to prove the entirety of his new Kingdom that he is a good sovereign and that he will recover the Hellenic lands. In doing so he will have the advantage of close relations with Germany and Austria, as well as with Russia, though that will upset France and the United Kingdom."
 GREpolitics.10.a:0 "Long live the new King"
 GREpolitics.11.t:0 "Republican coup d'Etat"
 GREpolitics.11.d:0 ""
 GREpolitics.11.a:0 "Down with the Monarchy"
 GREpolitics.12.t:0 "Revolutions all over Greece"
 GREpolitics.12.d:0 "After several months of severe political turbulence, and while the King and Queen are touring the province seeking support from the people, anti-Othonian revolutions have broken out all over Greece, and they seem to have the support of the majority of the Greek population. The revolutions began with the repressed Nauplian Revolution, but now bigger ones have broken out in Aetolia-Acarnania, where General Theodoros Grivas has declared a full scale rebellion, as well as in parts of the Peloponnese and the Aegean Islands. The situation is critical for Otto as he no longer has control over anything, and even the Great Powers seem to support the people's demand."

 GREdiplo.1.t:0 "The Treaty of London"
 GREdiplo.1.d:0 "On March 29th, 1864 representatives from the United Kingdom, Russia, Prussia and Greece met in London to agree upon ceding the Ionian Islands, currently a protectorate of the British to Greece. Charilaos Trikoupis, the Greek delegate, signed the agreement. The British will depart from the territory on October 2nd and let us take it over, but they will be allowed to retain the use of the Port of Corfu for military purposes. The agreement was largely influenced due to our election of an Anglophile King. The Ionian Islands are the first territory to become Greek, following independence."

 GREeconomy.1.d:0 "Today, on [GetDateText] the British Businessman Edward Pickering applied to receive the construction permit to build and operate the railway between Athens and Piraeus. The permit was granted and it is expected that construction will start within the two months. The railway was first proposed in 1835, but the proposal was very ahead of time and was ignored. The issue resurfaced on 1843 under the proposal of Foreign Minister Alexandros Rizas Ragazis, but he was too ignored. It was not until 1855 with the support of Foreign Minister Alexandros Mauvrokordatos that an edict was passed allowing for the construction of the Athens - Piraeus railway, but the political instability would prevent this from happening."

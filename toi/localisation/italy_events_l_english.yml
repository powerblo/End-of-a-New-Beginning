 sardinia.9.t:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont"
 sardinia.9.d:0 "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

 ita.8.t:0 "The Unification of Italy"
 ita.8.d:0 "King Victor Emmanuel gave a speech to the senators and deputies today about the unification of Italy. Almost entirely free and united, thanks to Providence, to the cooperation of all, and to the valor of our armies, Italy relies on your strength and wisdom. To you it belongs to give her uniform institutions and a determined organization. In establishing the greatest administrative liberties among peoples accustomed to different usages and a different organization, you will be careful not to weaken that political unity which has been the desire of so many centuries. The opinion of the most civilized, nations is favorable to us. The principles of and peace, and will powerfully contribute to universal civilization. The Emperor of the French, while firmly maintaining the principle of non-intervention, which is so advantageous to us, has deemed it his duty to recall his Ambassador. If this circumstance has been painful to us, it has not, however, diminished our feelings of gratitude, or our confidence in his love for the Italian cause. France and Italy, between whom there exists a community of race, traditions and manners, have drawn closer, in the fields of Magenta and Solferino, an alliance whose bonds are indissoluble. The Government and people of England, that ancient cradle of liberty, have loudly proclaimed our right to dispose of ourselves; they have greatly aided us by their good offices; our gratitude will never forget it. An illustrious and upright Prince has ascended the throne of Prussia. I have sent an Ambassador to him as a proof of our consideration as well as our sympathy, for the noble German nation, which, I hope, will be more and more convinced that the Constitution of Italian unity cannot injure either the rights or interests of other nations. I am certain that you will not hesitate to give my Government the means of completing warlike preparations by land and sea. Thus, the Kingdom of Italy, placed in a position not to dread an attack, will find more easily in the consciousness of its force reasons for opportune prudence. Under other circumstances my language was bold; for wisdom consists not less in knowing how to dare opportunely than to temporize opportunely. Devoted to Italy, I have never hesitated to risk for her my life and my crown, but no one has the right to risk the existence and fate of a nation. After signal victories, the Italian army, whose glory increased every day, has just acquired fresh titles by rendering itself master of one of the most formidable citadels. I feel the consolatory idea, that this feat of arms will close forever the painful series of our conflicts. The naval forces have proved in the waters of Ancona and of Gaeta, that the sailors of Pisa, of Genoa, and of Venice, are revived amongst us. A valiant youth, led on by a Captain who has filled the most distant countries with his name, have shown that neither servitude nor long misfortunes have weakened the nerves of the Italian people.There are facts which have inspired the nation with great confidence in its own destiny. I am happy to manifest to the first Italian Parliament the joy which fills my heart, as a King and as a soldier."

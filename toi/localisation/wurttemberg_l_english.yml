 wurttem.1.t:0 "Emigration Stops"
 wurttem.1.d:0 "Following our recent policies on emigration, we have successfully stopped the waves of people leaving our country. This outcome will greatly benefit us in the long term, but will probably bring little results at the start. Either way, the new workforce of [Root.GetName] should now be able to boost our economy."
 wurttem.1.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 wurttem.2.t:0 "Emigration Continues"
 wurttem.2.d:0 "Following our recent and rather harsh policies on emigration, the discouraged [Root.GetAdjective] people continue to leave our country, in search of better work and life.

 wurttem.4.d:0 "Even with our recent tries to advertise our country to settlers and farmers, the [Root.GetName] people still see no point in staying in our country. As they leave to find new work and life, taking their families with them, our workforce gets smaller by the day."
 wurttem.5.t:0 "Recovering from Unemployment"

 wurttem.6.t:0 "[WUR.GetName] Integrates Liberalism"
 wurttem.6.d:0 "Just this morning [WUR.GetNameDef] has announced their intentions on integrating Liberalism into their political system. Having experienced an uprise in popularity, Liberalism in [WUR.GetNameDef] is now stronger than ever, with supporters outside and inside the governmental structure. With Liberalism on the rise, the [WUR.GetAdjective] officials decided that they would rather talk things out than continuing the European trend of suppression.\nWhether this decision will have a greater impact on the German areas is yet to be seen. It is, however, quite clear that [WUR.GetNameDef] has developed into a state capable of thinking outside the box."
 wurttem.6.a:0 "This is the dawn of a new era for us."
 wurttem.6.b:0 "We should support their cause."
 wurttem.6.c:0 "Liberalism has no future in Europe."
 wurttem.7.t:0 "Württemberg Stands Against Liberalism"
 wurttem.7.d:0 "Just this morning [WUR.GetNameDef] has announced their intentions on further suppressing Liberalism in their country, seeing how the recent instabilities of the German areas have increased interest in and popularity of Liberalism. Feeling that the [WUR.GetAdjective] state might be endangered by the new Liberalistic behaviours and ideas, [WUR.GetLeader] has officially called for reactionary politics, stating that Liberalism in Germany is merely a \"periodic fever of wishes for elections\".\nWhether this decision will have a greater impact on the German areas is yet to be seen."
 wurttem.7.a:0 "It is for our own good."
 wurttem.7.b:0 "This is unheard of!"
 wurttem.7.c:0 "We should support their cause."
 wurttem.8.t:0 "The Schultheißwesen"
 wurttem.8.d:0 "For a long time have we utilized the Schultheißwesen now, a decentralized political system describing how every city and village is required to elect a representative who then acts as a head of the said commune. While this system allows for self-administration, it still involves the Gemeinderat, the council of a commune led by the representative, having judicative power over the affiliated area. We either could let the Gemeinderat have its judicative, or reform this system in such a way that we have more influence over it."
 wurttem.8.a:0 "We need to have more influence. Centralization is key now."
 wurttem.8.b:0 "Enforce the current version of the system."
 wurttem.9.t:0 "The Shifting Flow"
 wurttem.9.d:0 "Just now we received word from [WUR.GetLeader] himself that he would like [WUR.GetNameDef] to remain neutral on all fronts, shifting from supporting one nation to another if needed. While this might sound hypocritical at first, it would allow us to establish connections with the nations around us."
 wurttem.9.a:0 "This sounds like a great idea!"
 wurttem.9.b:0 "It would mean sitting in the shadows of others. We want none of that."
 wurttem.10.t:0 "Württemberg Proposes Establishing Friendship"
 wurttem.10.d:0 "Today we received a letter from [WUR.GetNameDef], stating that [WUR.GetLeader] would personally like to establish a lasting friendship and foreign policy with us. However, we also received word that we were not the only ones who received such letters. While we would not lose anything if we would accept, we should be aware that this kind of opportunism could go either way; lead to difficulties later, or become a great stone to step on later."
 wurttem.10.a:0 "We should accept this offer."
 wurttem.10.b:0 "We will not meddle with states trying to be friends with everyone."
 wurttem.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts!"
 wurttem.11.d:0 "We just received a letter from [From.GetNameDef], stating that they accept our proposal and look forward to a lasting friendship."
 wurttem.11.a:0 "A toast to our new [From.GetAdjective] friends!"
 wurttem.12.t:0 "[From.GetName] Denies!"
 wurttem.12.d:0 "We just received a letter from [From.GetNameDef], stating that they would rather have a neutral stance towards us than a binding friendship."
 wurttem.12.a:0 "We have to accept their decision."

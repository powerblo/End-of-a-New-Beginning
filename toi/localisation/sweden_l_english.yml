 SWE_lifeguard:0 "Deploy the Life Regiments!"
 SWE_lifeguard_desc:0 "Since the Liberation War of the 1500s, the Life Regiments have been the personal lifeguard of the King. Being owned, and therefore financed, by the wealthiest aristocrat in the Kingdom, they were traditionally better trained and equipped than their provincial counterparts. Though the centralisation of recent years mean that all regiments are owned and financed by the state, these regiments are still considered to be the more prestigious units in the Swedish Army, and are often personally commanded by the King in battle. Now more than ever, we need these units to enter the fray. With some... Gentle persuasion, we might be able to convince the King to resign his command, and appoint a far more competent Colonel in his stead. The Second-in-Command of the Life Regiment Hussars, Carl Herman Leuheusen, is a popular candidate"

 sweden_political.1.t:0 "The Municipal Reforms of [GetYear]"
 sweden_political.1.d:0 "Ever since the 1520s, cities and parishes in Sweden have been ruled to a near-dictatorial extent by Mayors undemocratically appointed by the Privy Council in Stockholm. This has been subject to heavy criticism with accusations of corruption, quid pro quos, and partisan bias being ever present. The heavy-handed approach of many frankly unqualified mayors has resulted in a general feeling of disenfranchisement among the peasantry. Public outcry demanding that Mayors be democratically elected and for Local Parliaments to be established have grown deafening, and many legislators have begun seriously discussing a widespread reform to address these issues. \n\nThe Current Consensus proposes that Parishes be abolished as juicidal regions entirely, and the country instead be divided into Municipalities, the size of which will be determined by population and area. Each municipality will have its own parliament of democratically elected representatives who are tasked to oversee the day-to-day business of the region. The Mayor, in this new system, will see his power signifcantly curtailed and will serve as little more than a figurehead. \n\nProponents of this reform argue that not only are these changes prinicipally justified for our society to be truly free, but also that it will decrease corruption and, with power distributed among many people rather than one, will result in a more competent administration. By abolishing parishes, we would also take steps in the direction of secularisation, where competancy is higher valued than your ability to cite scripture, the argument goes. \n\nOpponents cite tradition, arguing that it is wildly disrespectful to go against three centuries of heritage because some peasants feel repressed. With power based on local elections rather than Government Appointments, this also stands to challenge the more authoritarian minded of society."

 sweden_political.2.t:0 "The Trial of the Six"
 sweden_political.2.d:0 "Shock and Scandal is rocking the Kingdom following a very controversial court ruling in the capital. Six women are standing trial for heresy because of their Catholic faith. \n\nThe Kingdom of Sweden has had an extremely strong association with Luthernism and Protestantism ever since the days of the Thirty Years' War and Gustavus Adolphus the Great, and Catholicism has been forcefully rejected by the nation for hundreds of years. \n\nBut be that as it may, some people argue that the very reason Gustavus Adolphus the Great intervened in the Thirty Years' War in the first place was to protect religious freedom, and that the right to believe in any of the numerous interpretations of the Bible and Jesus Christ is the right of every Swedish citizen. The French and Spanish Embassies have also made a formal protest to the Government over this trial, calling it outrageous, and asking the Government to consider pardoning them. \n\nThe Government is facing a difficult call; Pardon the women, and trample all over the legal system, or, allow the Court to banish them, and risk angering the Catholics of Europe."

 sweden_political.3.t:0 "Lumber Boom!"
 sweden_political.3.d:0 "Wood, wood, wood! This may be a time of Steam and Steel, but the importance of lumber is perhaps greater than ever before! And, luckily for our economy, we got more of it than we could ever use! \n\nThe English, with their seemingly never-ending ship building, are paying ludicrious sums of money for lumber, and it has caused the Swedish Timber Industry to boom! Across the Kingdom, especially in the mostly unpopulated North, new steam-powered sawmills have begun to spring up in the hundreds. \nOur Export of lumber is going through the roof, and is projected to increase by several hundred percent in the coming months; Countless workers have found new well-paying, honest job in these sawmills. \nNot only is this helping reduce unemployment, but the tax revenue we are receiving from these Limber Companies is nothing short of jawdropping. \n\nSome of the Companies have started arguing that if they were to receive a tax cut, they could use that money to build even more mills and, in turn, employ even more workers. Doing this would surely upset some radicals however..."
 sweden_political.3.a:0 "They deserve a tax cut for their hard work!"

 sweden_political.4.t:0 "Long live the King"
 sweden_political.4.d:0 "Earlier today, his Majesty King Oscar I passed away. \n\nHis Majesty has suffered from serious illnesses for the last 30 years, but through pure willpower has stayed alive. However, he never truly recovered from the death of his son Prince Gustaf six years ago. Since that traumatic event, he has been suffering severe memory loss, and after a stroke two years ago, he became paralyzed. At the recommendation of his Doctor, he stepped down from all public affairs shortly thereafter and appointed Crown Prince Charles to serve as the regent in his stead. After stepping down, it seemed like he was starting to recover, however, around one year ago, his health took a rapid turn for the worse. In the last few months he has been slipping in and out of consciousness, the once proud King having been reduced to an incoherent, shivering wreck. \n\nYesterday evening, his condition became critical, and his family quickly travelled to the Royal Palace to say their farewells. The autopsy revealed an egg-sized tumor inh is brain, which is the likely cause of death. \n\nThough his passing has not come as a great shock, it is regardless a great tradgedy, and the country is in mourning. \n\nCrown Prince Charles has assumed the official position of King of Sweden, and his coronation is scheduled for May next year."

 sweden_political.5.t:0 "The S.W.A.F.D is founded!"
 sweden_political.5.d:0 "The Swedish Women's Association for the Fatherlands Defense, or SWAFD for short, was founded earlier today in Stockholm. The association, with aims to start a grassroots movement to encourage patriotism and support for the Armed Forces, has already started the process of raising several hundred-thousand crowns to support the Army through lotteries and donations. \nIt's chairman, Lady Lotta von Plomgren, impassionately pleaded to the \"Daughters of the Fatherland to support its Defenders!\" in the Church of St. Nicholas in one of the numerous events to support the Army. \n\nThough some members of the Military feel bitter about receiving help from the lesser sex, there is no denying that the extra money and grassroots support will prove invaluable, both in terms of financing expansions, and finding new personell."

 sweden_political.6.t:0 "The Bessemer Process reaches Sweden!"
 sweden_political.6.d:0 "The Bessemer Process, named after its inventor Henry Bessemmer has finally started to gain traction in Sweden! \n\nThe Process, which uses oxidation and other chemical reactions to make high-quality steel from cheap Pig Iron, has the potential to enable, for the first time in history, the ability to mass produce steel relatively cheaply. \n\nThough experiments with the process were initially unsuccessful in Sweden, businessman Pontus Kleman and Metallurgical Engineer Johan Leffler have managed to create the first successful Ironwork which utilizes the process. Though this is revolutionary, it is still met with some skepticism from larger Ironworks, who argue that this is Alchemy and Chrysopoeia all over again."
 sweden_political.6.a:0 "Very impressive!"

 USA_Westpoint1:0 "West Point Napoleonic Thought"
 USA_Westpoint1_desc:0 "West Point Academy has grown to become the most esteemed and well-known military academy in the United States. They have given us great men and leaders, and is responsible for the abilities our leaders possess. However, it is entrenched in Napoleonic Era thought, and passes this to the graduates who will continue to use Napoleonic tactics. Unless a great catastrophe shows us the way, we are expected to see this thought continue through the decades."
 USA_Westpoint2:0 "West Point Modernizing"
 USA_Westpoint2_desc:0 "The Civil War has shown us the calamity of Napoleonic Era thought in modern day. The reason for the organization of our forces was because of the innacurate weapons that Napoleon was expected to face, but such weapons are long gone. Many men bled on the fields because we allowed them to stand in lines in such a old and useless tradition. We must rectify this, and encourage new thought in West Point Academy."

With the Buchanan Presidency failing, or refusing, to crack down on such Corruption, measures by the US Congress must be needed in order to get rid of this corruption."

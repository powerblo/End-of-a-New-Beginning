 sepoy.1.d:0 "The year is 1857, and our country has suddenly been ripped into an abyss of turmoil and war. Rising conflict between the British East India Company and our people have led to an incident this morning that has sparked a war: A Mutiny in Meerut.

 usa.0.t:0 "The Divided States of America"
 usa.0.d:0 "It is a bleak time for the United States. Ever since we declared ourselves independent, we have been toiled by the issues of the Slavery. Although the United States would implement policies on Slavery, such as the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, but even still this institution would continue. \n \nThere were many compromises between the Free States and the Slave States. The Free States existed in the North, which consists of rockier soil and colder climates. Those would move the North away from agriculture and into Factories, therefore pushing the instituion out of the North. Meanwhile, the South's warmer climate and rich soil made it easy to exploit agriculture in the area, and as such made the instituion survive there. \n \nDebates would arise from which states would be allowed to have Slavery, resulting in a power struggle between the Northern States and Southern states, until the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which stipulated the 36°30' line, which made up Missouri's southern border, to become the new border between North and South. States North of this would be free and states South would have slavery. \n \nThis Compromise would be broken 3 decades later, however, with the Mexican-American War resulting in states like Texas and California joining the Union. The size of Texas and the wish for California to become a free state reignited the debate of Slavery. This would lead to the Compromise of 1850, which was devised by Whig Senator Henry Clay and Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas, and the compromise stipulated the Fugitive Slave clause which sparked more tension, aswell as the act of Popular Sovreignity. allowing for states themselves to choose between slavery or free states. Most notable being the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which led to issues such as Bleeding Kansas, where Northern and Southern migrants to Kansas would cause violence to turn Kansas to their side of the Slave Debate. \n \nThe situation of Slavery has been driven harsh, with the Whig party dead and the rise of the Republican Party, which recieved 33% of the vote in the Election of 1856, but had still lost the election to Buchanan. \n \nThe future of the United States is in question."

 usa.6.d:0 "Introduced by Stephen Douglas in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska act allowed for the people in the Kansas and Nebraska territories to choose if they would want slavery or not. This has led to many Northern Abolitionists and Southern Pro-Slavers to move to Kansas to push for their beliefs in the conflict of Slavery. This has spilled blood many times, one example being abolitionist John Brown who led his sons and other followers to attack farmers who supported slavery. \n \nRecently, the Marais des Cygnes massacre occured, where Pro-Slavery Border Ruffians killed 5 Anti-Slavery men. With the tensions of the Slave Debate, this has led to more conflict in the Kansas Territory."

I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.\" In the North, many have called him a martyr, while the South is relieved that their terrorist is gone."

In the contents, it issued many things, such as California's admission as a Free State. \n \nHowever, issues are arising with the Fugitive Slave Law that was enacted alongsie with the Compromise. Any Slave that fled into the North was to be taken back to their slaveowners. This has led to it becoming a issue with the Slavery Debate heating up, and some Northerners have been arrested for having hid runaway slaves in order to protect them."

The Republican Party's nominee is Abraham Lincoln, a charismatic figure that opposes expansion of Slavery. The Democratic Party is split between two, the Northern Democrats favor Stephen A Douglas, who favors a moderate solution in Slavery and therefore will likely not recieve many votes. But the Southern Democrats demand for John Beckinridge, current Vice President under Buchanan, who promises to ensure the institution of slavery in the west. \n \nThis may be the tipping point that decides on the issue of slavery. If either North nor South get their candidate, they may rebel against the current system. But for now, the new President of the United States is..."

It seems as though the only ones that would refuse this were the rich White plantation owners in the South and radical abolitionists in the North, who have lost support when the Referendum had been announced. \n \nThere have been four different plans for the Referendum. 1: The Abolition Plan, which, if passed, would ban the practice of Slavery. 2: The Popular Sovreignity Plan, which people can vote if their state wants or doesn't want slavery. 3: The 30 Years Plan, where the US would slowly cut down on Slavery until Abolishment in a span of 30 years. Or 4: The Reformed Slavery Plan, which promises to implement a form of Slavery that prohibits harsh treatment of Slaves. \n \nThe time to choose is now, the fate of the nation is in our hands..."

Instead of drilling for salt water and removing the oil had orignially been a byproduct of making the salted water drinkable.

After being ill for a total of three days, Maximilian's body could no longer withstand the disease and fell victim to it. Maximilian II, being King of Bavaria for 16 years, died on the 10th March 1864, ultimately leaving the throne empty. This event will certainly influence the very existence of our Kingdom."

 bavariafocus.1.d:0 "As the oldest son of Maximilian II with a right to the throne, Ludwig II Otto Friedrich Wilhelm von Wittelsbach ascended at the age of just 18 years after his fathers death, and is now officially the new King of Bavaria. Seeing as how the young King could be or have been a subject of manipulation from a foreign state, many politicians are worried about how Ludwig could behave in the future. In an attempt to eliminate this risk, a proposal has been made by some of the worried, which would try to persuade the King. The proposal would try to bring Ludwig II closer to his fathers work, and maybe even push for the continuation of the Triaspolitik. However, a lot of people think that this would lead to no result, as Ludwig never was and probably still isn't interested in his fathers work and way of ruling. Whatever we decide to do, this will impact the future of the Kingdom of Bavaria greatly."

Today Ludwig II, the eldest son of Maximilian II, was found dead, bleeding onto the white duvet cover, in his room by a maid, after she seemingly heard some kind of commotion going on inside. After she hesitantly entered the room no one aside from the dead Ludwig was in it anymore. His throat was pierced with a sharp knife or sword. The assassination and its real reason remain a mistery for now, but it is clear that the murder is connected to Maximilian's death and Ludwig's planned ascension of the throne."

This idea of a unified coalition in the south again experienced an upsurge in popularity after the German Revolution and is even being supported by France.

 bavariafocus.9.d:0 "The South German Zollverein became reality and now Bavaria wants to push even further. The proposed South German Confederation is a military and economic alliance between allied German middle states. Accepting it means giving up on getting Prussia or Austria as allies and being on our own. There are two ways this could turn out - either the new South German Confederation is not supported by many middle states, marking its demise, or it becomes the Third Deutschland, the third big power in middle Europe.

 bavariafocus.14.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Accepted!"
 bavariafocus.14.d:0 "No one believed this could happen - and yet it did. The conservative groups simply could not get the government to accept classic Catholicism again.

While it would make sense for them to ask us to become allies, maybe we should not meddle with the German middle states too much. On the other hand, with some political work, we could get a foothold in Bavaria, possibly making a battle against Prussia easier."
 bavariafocus.15.a:0 "The more allies on our side - the better."
 bavariafocus.15.b:0 "We don't need them."
 bavariafocus.16.t:0 "Bavaria - An Ally?"
 bavariafocus.16.d:0 "Yet again Bavarian advisors arrive in Vienna. This time their proposal is more drastic - seeing how Prussia keeps pushing their demands, Bavaria now wants us an official ally against them, feeling threatened by Prussia. This might be our chance to completely bring Bavaria on our side. However, this might incite the Prussians."
 bavariafocus.16.a:0 "If you think about it, Bavaria is not that different from Austria."
 bavariafocus.16.b:0 "We may have a common enemy, but we can manage alone."
 bavariafocus.17.t:0 "Talks With Austria Going Well"
 bavariafocus.17.d:0 "Today our advisors came back from Vienna with good news. Our proposals to Austria were accepted and the relationship between our two countries is steadily growing. While this is good news to us, Prussia should not be that happy about this development. We should tread with cation."
 bavariafocus.17.a:0 "This will help our relationship grow."
 bavariafocus.18.t:0 "Talks With Austria Continue to Go Well"
 bavariafocus.18.d:0 "And again our advisors come back, bringing good news with them. Austria now officially sees us as an ally after considering the pros and cons of this coalition. As long as our common enemy Prussia exists, this coalition will too."
 bavariafocus.18.a:0 "In these times allies are a must."
 bavariafocus.19.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Support Bismarck's Parliament"
 bavariafocus.19.d:0 "Bismarck's proposal for a parliament seems to have found some popularity in Bavaria. This proposal is Bismarck's last try to bring the German middle states together and maybe with Bavaria agreeing to it it could succeed. Time will tell, but for now Bavaria seems to have become a little more open to Prussian politics. We could either accept their support, or reject it, the choice is still ours."
 bavariafocus.19.a:0 "It's not too late for them."
 bavariafocus.19.b:0 "They're just trying to kiss up to us."
 bavariafocus.20.t:0 "Prussia Accepts our Support!"
 bavariafocus.20.d:0 "Prussia just accepted our support for Bismarck's parliament. Maybe this will bring us a step closer to a German unification, or at least improve the relation between Bavaria and Prussia. Either way, this is good news, and we can stop holding our breath."
 bavariafocus.20.a:0 "Maybe we can avoid escalation after all."
 bavariafocus.21.t:0 "Bavaria Wants Unity"
 bavariafocus.21.d:0 "Bavaria once again wants to support our deed, and this time it is about German unity. Seeing how a war is probably inevitable, Bavaria wants to support us. While we do not think that Bavaria really wants to go to war, but only tries to gain some allies in case of it, they could be a good ally to have in the south. At the very least the Bavarian territory could be used as a temporary buffer between the German middle states and us."
 bavariafocus.21.a:0 "Very well, there shall be unity."
 bavariafocus.21.b:0 "Nothing but lies. We shouldn't trust them."
 bavariafocus.22.t:0 "Prussia Agrees!"
 bavariafocus.22.d:0 "After some wait, we have received message that Prussia agreed to our support. Now we have a strong ally on our side, but are right between the other German states and Austria, all of whom are strictly against Prussian reforms. Still, we now do not have to fear being alone in the case of war."
 bavariafocus.22.a:0 "Today is a good day."
 #(Austria)
 bavariafocus.23.t:0 "Military Consultative Commission"
 bavariafocus.23.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results state that there is a high possibility of us surviving the upcoming war if we were to fight on Austrias side, as the latest developments have shown that Austria has a high enough political opinion of us to be our ally. Ultimately we did not learn anything we did not know before, seeing how Austria agreed to all of our proposals. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side."
 bavariafocus.23.a:0 "The commission is over."
 #(lean Austria)
 bavariafocus.24.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were less clear than we had hoped them to be, stating that while Austria has its differences, it would probably be still a better idea to fight on their side instead of trying to survive alone. The Austrians agreed to most of our proposals, making an alliance in the case of war likely, but not definite. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side in case of war, but still be careful around them."
 #(Prussia)
 bavariafocus.25.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were surprising, to say the least, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally. Prussia and Bavaria are not the best friends per se and have their cultural and political differences, but recent developments have shown that the Prussians might not be as aggressive against Bavaria as we thought them to be. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussia's side."
 #(lean Prussia)
 bavariafocus.26.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were slightly surprising, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally in case of war. However, the commission pointed out that Prussia's main goal is to expand their reach, meaning one day they might turn against us. As such we should be very careful when joining an alliance with Prussia. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussias side, but still have an eye on their actions."
 #(neutral)
 bavariafocus.27.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were disappointing at most, if anything. Instead of producing a clear statement, the commission could not find an agreement between its members. As such, not Prussia nor Austria seem to be good options in case of war. Maybe we should try to stay neutral, even if that seems unlikely at first."
 bavariafocus.28.t:0 "Bavarian Customs"
 bavariafocus.28.d:0 "Bavaria is a country of culture, arts and customs. With the new Republic established, however, we now have to ask ourselves if this can go on like this. We could try convincing our people to be more understanding towards other cultures and religions, and separate state and religion."
 bavariafocus.28.a:0 "Our customs and culture are important to our people."
 bavariafocus.28.b:0 "Maybe a change of pace would be good."
 bavariafocus.29.t:0 "Bavaria Decides"
 bavariafocus.29.d:0 "With two Kings gone in such a short time and new social ideas embraced, the government is in a turmoil. Now is our chance to form the future of our country, by taking the leashes in our own hands. Before we do any mistakes we will regret doing in the future though, we must first decide how to approach this. We could either try to take over the government from the inside, or call for a revolution."
 bavariafocus.29.a:0 "This is our chance to take over the government without any bloodshed."
 bavariafocus.29.b:0 "There is no way the nobles will give in. The only way is revolution."
 bavariafocus.30.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts!"
 bavariafocus.30.d:0 "[From.GetName] seemingly liked our proposal, and accepted it! Now we can move on and gather other allies. Together we are strong!"
 bavariafocus.30.a:0 "Great news!"
 bavariafocus.31.t:0 "[From.GetName] Denies!"
 bavariafocus.31.d:0 "To our regret, [From.GetName] denied our proposal. We should move on and try convincing others to join us."
 bavariafocus.31.a:0 "They don't understand how important this is."
 bavariafocus.32.t:0 "Nuremberg's Industrie- und Kulturverein Established!"
 bavariafocus.32.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Industrie- und Kulturverein in Nuremberg has been established. It will actively try to support and stimulate our industry and spread of our culture. Additionally it will help us gain more local influence in Nuremberg."
 bavariafocus.32.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 bavariafocus.33.t:0 "Bezirksamt Erlangen Established!"
 bavariafocus.33.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Bezirksamt Erlangen has been established. Because of how fast Erlangen, the small city in the proximity of Nuremberg has grown, the Bezirksamt makes sure that we as the Bavarian government have full control over the agrarian culture and industry in that area."
 bavariafocus.33.a:0 "Wunderbar!"
 bavariafocus.34.t:0 "The Culture of Munich"
 bavariafocus.34.d:0 "Since Ludwig I Munich has been the centre of Bavarian culture. The city is the main contributor to the Bavarian image and is our capital at the same time. As instructed by us, Bavarian culture will now go beyond Munich and reach even the smallest villages and towns of the [Root.GetName]."
 bavariafocus.34.a:0 "Ausgezeichnet!"
 bavariafocus.35.t:0 "The Pride of the Bavarians"
 bavariafocus.35.d:0 "Today [Root.GetLeader] made a speech, telling the people that they, as [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s, should be proud of themselves. The speech was received with loud clapping and the following night one could hear and see joyful singing, dancing and drinking everywhere. Ein Prosit auf Bayern!"
 bavariafocus.35.a:0 "We are a proud nation!"
 bavariafocus.36.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Play Big"
 bavariafocus.36.d:0 "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that from now on it wants to play a bigger role in the Concert of Europe, and find its place in it. Seeing how it is the biggest and most influential German middle state, some think that Bavaria's wish to be noticed by others could be succesful, provided they take part in international politics, like the big powers do. Others, however, think that this wish is merely that, noting that the Kingdom of Bavaria never before had any interest in being a part of the Concert. While small countries like some other German middle states seemingly want Bavaria to succeed in becoming more important, the main and long-established powers in Europe, mainly France, Prussia and Austria, would like Bavaria to stay in its current position."
 bavariafocus.36.a:0 "Onwards, Bavaria!"
 bavariafocus.36.b:0 "This is merely wishful thinking."
 bavariafocus.37.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Play Safe"
 bavariafocus.37.d:0 "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that it wants to keep out of big, European politics. While it wants to still play a role in German matters, Bavaria does not wish to intervene in international ones. This decision, however, does not seem to surprise anyone, especially not seeing how big the main powers, namely France, Prussia and Austria have become. Seemingly not wanting to abandon its introvert policies and culture, Bavaria wants to turn its attention to German areas, instead of trying to keep up with the neighbouring powerhouses that are Austria and Prussia."
 bavariafocus.37.a:0 "We shall keep our principles."
 bavariafocus.37.b:0 "A wise decision."
 bavariafocus.38.t:0 "Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal Extended!"
 bavariafocus.38.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal has been extended. Finished in 1846 and built during the reign of Ludwig I, the Donau-Main-Kanal has been an important tool for Bavarian trade ever since. With the expansion finished, it now allows us to use more ships for trade, making Bavaria more important when it comes to trading."
 bavariafocus.38.a:0 "Ships sure are something."
 bavariafocus.39.t:0 "Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn Extended!"
 bavariafocus.39.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn has been extended. Named after Ludwig I, just like the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal, it allows for fast transportation between Franconia and Upper Bavaria, even going so far to reach Saxony. After extending it with additional lines, it now grants us the possibility to transport our goods to more corners of Bavaria faster than ever before."
 bavariafocus.39.a:0 "Trains sure are something."
 bavariafocus.40.t:0 "Southgerman Confederation Formed!"
 bavariafocus.40.d:0 "It seems that the Triaspolitik of Bavaria and the other German middle states finally payed off. As of late, the middle states have been making common policy, guided by Bavaria, the biggest and most probably strongest middle state in the German area. Today, after endless discourses and debates, the Southgerman Confederation was born, officially lead by Bavaria. It is advertised by its members as the Third Deutschland, the third big Germanic power, right beside Austria and Prussia. However, it still remains a mystery whether this brand new alliance will bear any fruit and keep up with the European powers."
 bavariafocus.40.a:0 "We will be a power to be reckoned with."
 bavariafocus.40.b:0 "The Third Deutschland is now formed."
 bavariafocus.41.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins the Southgerman Zollverein!"

 bavariafocus.42.t:0 "[From.GetName] Denies the Southgerman Zollverein!"
 bavariafocus.42.d:0 "We just received word that [From.GetName] has refused our proposal. Seeing no future in the new Southgerman Zollverein, they decided to stick to the old one."
 bavariafocus.42.a:0 "What do they even gain from this decision!?"
 bavariafocus.43.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins the Southgerman Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.43.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjectiveCap] government today told us that they will support our cause, agree to our proposal and that [From.GetName] will join the Southgerman Zollverein. They are now de jure a member."
 bavariafocus.43.a:0 "United we are strong!"
 bavariafocus.44.t:0 "[From.GetName] Denies the Southgerman Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.44.d:0 "After having considered the up- and downsides of our proposal, [From.GetName] decided to not join the new Southgerman Confederation. We will have to search for other members."

 bavariaevent.0.t:0 "Maximilian II Tries to Push for Reforms"
 bavariaevent.0.d:0 "The Bavarian King Maximilian II has today suggested withdrawing the freedom of the press and suffrage. Remembering the German Revolution of 1848 and 1849, the King thinks that there should be stricter laws to prevent a return of such a movement. However, multiple advisors and politicians are unsure if that really is such a good idea. Many are concerned that such reforms could incite the people, making the situation only worse. Whether these suggested reforms will be implemented or not is still up in the air."
 bavariaevent.0.a:0 "We will follow the King's will."
 bavariaevent.1.t:0 "Frankfurter Fürstentag"
 bavariaevent.1.d:0 "The Frankfurter Fürstentag session began today on the 17th August 1863. The Fürstentag was initated by the Austrian Kaiser and deals with proposed reforms regarding the German Confederation. The proposed reforms, if enacted, would inter alia set up a parliamentary committee, bringing the German Confederation nearer to being a Federal State. On the other hand, Prussia proposed other plans for the reorganization of the German Confederation. We either could support the Austrian proposals, disapprove of them and support the Prussian ones or stay neutral."
 bavariaevent.1.a:0 "We will support the Austrian proposals."
 bavariaevent.1.b:0 "We don't want to incite anybody."
 bavariaevent.1.c:0 "We will support the Prussia proposals."
 bavariaevent.2.t:0 "King Max's Hike"
 bavariaevent.2.d:0 "Maximilian II today hiked in the Alpine region in Upper Bavaria. The total length of the path amounts up to 26 km and stretches from the Hörnle summit by Bad Kohlgrub, the royal Jagdhaus on the Pürschling and the Klammspitze summit to the Brunnenkopfhäuser built by King Max himself."
 bavariaevent.2.a:0 "We should name this path after our King!"
 bavariaevent.3.t:0 "Common Policy with [From.GetNameDef]"
 bavariaevent.3.d:0 "Our recent political actions have impressed the [From.GetAdjectiveCap] ministers and politicians. After many discussions, proposals and debates, our two countries finally agreed to make common policy and to grow stronger together in the future - side by side."
 bavariaevent.3.a:0 "A Prost to our new [From.GetAdjectiveCap] friends!"
 bavariaevent.4.t:0 "Common Policy with [From.GetNameDef]"
 bavariaevent.4.d:0 "Afraid that our latest try to make common policy with the [From.GetAdjectiveCap] would stir up the relations between them and other German states, [From.GetName] denied our proposal. However, they seem to be moved by our newly embraced open politics and want to stay on friendly terms."
 bavariaevent.4.a:0 "It is a shame, but we will have to respect their decision."
 bavariaevent.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Proposes Common Policy"

 bavariaevent.7.t:0 "The German Question"
 bavariaevent.7.d:0 "Now that the German threat is gone, the Austrians will look forward to unite Germany as they like. Luckily, we chose the right side and are now one of the winners. As such, we are allowed to partake in the peace talks. We could try to have a say and get a few advantages for ourselves, but we also could leave it up to the Austrians. However, if we were to take part in the peace talks, we would need to keep in mind that our chance of achieving what we want would be dependent on how much our country developed or performed in the war."
 bavariaevent.7.a:0 "We should try to have a say."
 bavariaevent.7.b:0 "Let's leave it up to the Austrians."
 bavariaevent.8.t:0 "Treaty of Frankfurt"
 bavariaevent.8.d:0 "The peace talks are finally here. As we decided to have a say and be present during the talks, we now have to propose our demands or suggestions. As the North, led by Prussia, lost the war, we now have full control over Germany and can push through our interests.\n\nFirstly, we could demand the annexation of the Ruhrgebiet by Bavaria, as we already own Palatinate in that region. This could greatly benefit our industry, but we should be aware that if the Austrians do not recognize Bavaria as an industrializing country, we would have little chances in succeeding with this demand.\n\nAnother approach would be to just sit at the table, but let the Austrians do all the actual work. Being present at the peace talks and being victorious already makes us quite popular. Additionally, it would not be a bad idea to be on the good side of the Austrians.\n\nThe by far most daring suggestions would be the ones concerning the German unification. As to not be completely thrown aside, we could try to submit some ideas on how the unification should go."
 bavariaevent.8.a:0 "The Ruhr is rightfully Bavarian soil. We should demand it to be handed over to us."
 bavariaevent.8.b:0 "Whatever the Austrians say, we should agree for the sake of relations."

 bavariaevent.9.t:0 "Bavaria Demands the Ruhrgebiet"
 bavariaevent.9.d:0 "Taking part in the peace talks, [BAV.GetNameDef] today demanded the Ruhr to be officially handed over to them. As we have defeated the Prussians on the field, we theoretically can do whatever we want with that piece of land. In fact, if Bavaria were to annex the Ruhrgebiet, it would weaken the industry of [PRS.GetNameDef] immensely. We could, however, decline and do something else with it."
 bavariaevent.9.a:0 "Let them have it. Bavaria is a friend."
 bavariaevent.9.b:0 "We shouldn't give Bavaria more power."
 bavariaevent.10.t:0 "Deutscher Staatenbund"
 bavariaevent.10.d:0 "As no apparent answer to the German Question could have been found until now, we have to decide what to do for the time being. Unification seems to be a much more complicated thing to accomplish than we thought it would be, and now we have to act before the German states turn away from us.\nMany in our government have come to like the temporary idea of forming a Schutzbund, a temporary, protective federation, to ensure stability and safety along the German areas. It was decided that this faction is to be established within the next days. However, it is yet to be decided how to handle this federation; we could either directly subjugate the German states and initiate the Schutzbund to play safe, or we could create the Schutzbund without subjugating anyone, as that could lead to mistrust."

Every German state would be forcefully annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich. If we were to agree to this proposal, German unification would finally be accomplished and we would have full power over all German land without risking too much, like protests in our home country. However, we have to keep in mind that this possibly could be a power grab from Bavaria, even though they have been quite well-disposed towards us."

 bavariaevent.12.t:0 "Bavaria Proposes Unification"
 bavariaevent.12.d:0 "Today [BAV.GetNameDef] proposed the final unification of Germany under Bavaria as our subject. Every German state would be annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich, except from the ones who were our allies in the past war. Instead, our past allies, mostly consisting of the southern German states, would be asked whether they would like to become a part of the to be formed German Confederation. If they deny, they will simply become subjects of the new Germany, maintaining their old and rightful borders and territories. It is now up to us to decide whether this new Germany becomes reality, or not."

 bavariaevent.13.t:0 "The Road to Unification"
 bavariaevent.13.d:0 "The time has come to present our plans for Germany to the Austrians. Still, we need to decide what exactly we will propose to them; on that matter we have two major ideas on how to establish a unified Germany.\n\nThe first idea would be to forcefully unify Germany under Bavaria, while Bavaria itself becomes a subjugated state of Austria. This would make our dream of a Bavarian Germany reality, even if Austria would become our overlord.\n\nThe second idea would be to give the German states who were our allies in the previous war a choice: either they join us and become a part of the New Germany, or they maintain their borders, but are subjugated to us.\n\nWhile the first idea sounds more pleasing, the second one would ensure that no previous ally turns sour on us. However, we should note that the ones who have the final say remain the Austrians. Whether they will accept our proposal depends on how we decided to be seen by the other European powers."

The Austrians accepted the Bavarian proposal, seemingly liking the sound of finally uniting the German states, and as such [GEC.GetNameDef] was born.

Additional heritage sites would cause the industry to suffer to an extent, which could cause us to be unprepared in the next war, which they predict will be won based on who has the best technology and industry. \n\nThe final decision is now up to you, Kaiser."

 aus.9.d:0 "It is now the year 1857, and although nine years have passed since the Revolutions of 1848, the legacy of the uprisings still scar the empire. Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did. Oh, Kaiser Franz Josef! Lead the Austrian Empire to glory, unite its people, and bring justice to its enemies!"

 aus.10.t:0 "The Situation in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia"
 aus.10.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and its inhabitants have brought the Austrian Empire nothing but trouble since 1848. The "Risorgimento" movement for Italian unification has been the worst of our worries regarding the Italian region. For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us. Therefore, we must do anything in our power to keep resistance to a minimum and to keep a unified Italy from coming to fruition."
 aus.10.a:0 "We must stand firm."

The hot temperatures this month have made water in the river evaporate, so that huge piles of industrial and human waste products remained on its banks, combining with the hot air to generate a stink that is so unbearable, boat travel on the river has almost completely stopped and noone dares step near it anymore to preserve their own wellbeing. We must do something about this!"

# Timeline-of-Iron
A Hearts of Iron IV project that extends the timeline from 1860 to the modern day.
The American Civil War, Scramble for Africa, Unification of Germany and the Great Game are just some examples of the immense events that will be available in the Timeline of Iron. Expect an absolute, complete overhaul of everything you remember about HOI4.

Right now Timeline of Iron is in experimental state- before the initial release of 0.0. After the minimal playable version of 0.0 is released, the mod will be an official public project, and core content will be added. When most content available from vanilla mechanics are stable, we plan to add new mechanics that match the Civil War era, or the modern day.

All updates should be sent on Discord and uploaded by me (powerblo) or someone that has access to Github. DO NOT try to directly upload files, and be sure to
1. ALWAYS keep a backup of what you've done before you update from Github.
2. ALWAYS inform the devs of what you've done before you send us the files.
3. ALWAYS download and keep the versions marked "stable", and steer clear from the ones marked "unstable".
4. ALWAYS (in fact, as much as you can) make separate files for your content.
